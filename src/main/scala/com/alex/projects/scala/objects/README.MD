### Singleton object
A Singleton object is an object which defines a single object of a class. A singleton object provides an entry point to your program execution. If you do not create a singleton object in your program, then your code compile successfully but does not give output. 

### Companion object 
Companion object is known as an object whose name is same as the name of the class. Or In other words, when an object and a class have the same name, then that object is known as the companion object and the class is known as companion class. A companion object is defined in the same source file in which the class is defined. A companion object is allowed to access both private methods and private fields of the class.
